# Atlas Obscura Email Newsletter

## About

This is a recreation of Atlas Obscura's Email newsletter.


## What I Learned From This Job

- HTML Table layouts.
- Inline CSS.
- Image hosting & testing across various email providers. 
- Multi Column Layouts
- Image editing
- Preview Header


## What I Enjoyed About Creating This

The alternating layouts for some sections were fun to create. This one also had more colors than my previous projects and a ton of images of different sizes to work with. I felt my email development skills take a big leap on this project. :muscle:
